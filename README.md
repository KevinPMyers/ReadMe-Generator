# Read Me Generator

## Description

This is an application written with Node.js and JavaScript. The purpose of this application is to stream line creating a readme for any given project you are making on github. In order to run, clone this repository into your desired directory using your terminal. Once it is cloned, open VS code with the terminal open. Once you are on the command line, type in "node index.js" to run the program. You will be prompted with a series of questions intended to populate the ReadMe for your project. Once you have finished your questions add the generated responses to your own project from the ReadMeGen.md file.
